# Exploring KNN vs SVM via IMDB Reviews     

The notebook was copied from the notebook by Andrej Karpathy. Check it out here: https://github.com/karpathy/randomfun/blob/master/knn_vs_svm.ipynb

I added on to the original notebook with an application to IMDB reviews using sentence-level embeddings from `paraphrase-distilroberta-base-v1`. 
I think the results provide a qualitative look at the usage of SVMs for semantic similarity.
